        // 2. Add the students in Student.STUDENTS_ARRAY to your ArrayList

        // 3. Create a function named displayStudents(), which takes an ArrayList<Student>
        //    and prints the list of students and their grades. (No code needs to be added to
        //    main() for this step.

        // 4. Sort the ArrayList into alphabetical order by student name and then display
        //    its contents with displayStudents(). First, change the Student class to implement
        //    Comparable<Student>, then write a compareTo method to handle the sorting by name
        //    Then call sort(null) on the ArrayList before displaying it.

        // 5. Create a HashMap<String, Student> and add the students in the ArrayList to it.
        //    Use the student's name as the key and the student object as the value. This way
        //    students can be efficiently looked up in the HashMap.

        // 6. Use the HashMap to help you set Joshua's grade to 95. Then print out the list of students again.
